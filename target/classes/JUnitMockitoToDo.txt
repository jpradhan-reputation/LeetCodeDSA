Fundamental TDD Concepts:
=========================

1. Introduction to Test-Driven Development (TDD)
   - Understanding the TDD process and principles.
   - The Red-Green-Refactor cycle.

2. Setting Up the Development Environment
   - Installing JUnit and Mockito.
   - Configuring your IDE for TDD.

3. Writing Your First JUnit Test
   - Creating a JUnit test class.
   - Writing simple test cases using assertions.

4. Introduction to Mockito
   - Understanding the role of Mockito in mocking dependencies.
   - Mocking vs. Stubbing.

5. Test Fixtures and Setup
   - Using `@Before` and `@After` for test setup and teardown.
   - Initializing test data.

6. Test-Driven Development Workflow
   - Writing a failing test case (Red phase).
   - Implementing the code to make the test pass (Green phase).
   - Refactoring to improve code quality (Refactor phase).

Advanced TDD Topics:
====================

7. Mockito in Depth
   - Mocking dependencies and behaviors.
   - Verifying method calls and interactions.

8. TDD for Complex Scenarios
   - Testing code with dependencies and collaborators.
   - Mocking database access, web services, and external systems.

9. Parameterized Tests
   - Using parameterized tests to test multiple input scenarios.
   - Reducing duplication in test code.

10. Test Doubles and Stubs
    - Working with test doubles, such as stubs and fakes.
    - Creating custom stubs for specific test scenarios.

11. Test-Driven Design (TDD)
    - Design principles in TDD.
    - Refactoring code to improve design.

12. Continuous Integration and Automated Testing
    - Setting up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing.
    - Running tests automatically on code commits.

13. Test Coverage and Metrics
    - Understanding code coverage and its importance.
    - Measuring test quality using coverage tools.

14. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
    - Introduction to BDD and tools like Cucumber.
    - Writing behavior-driven tests.

15. Integration and End-to-End Testing
    - Writing integration tests that cover the interaction between components.
    - End-to-end testing of complete system functionality.

16. Best Practices in TDD
    - Guidelines for writing effective and maintainable tests.
    - Ensuring tests are independent, isolated, and repeatable.

17. Testing Legacy Code with TDD
    - Strategies for introducing TDD in legacy codebases.
    - Refactoring and adding tests to legacy code.

18. Mockito Best Practices
    - Advanced Mockito techniques and best practices.
    - Improving test readability and maintainability.

19. Testing for Performance and Security
    - Performance testing and profiling.
    - Security testing in TDD.

20. Real-world TDD Use Cases and Case Studies
    - Analyzing and implementing TDD in real-world scenarios.
    - Best practices from case studies.
