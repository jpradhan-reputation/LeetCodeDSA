Fundamental Spring Boot Data JPA Concepts:
==========================================

1. Introduction to Spring Boot Data JPA
   - Understanding the purpose and advantages of Spring Boot Data JPA.

2. Entity Classes
   - Creating and annotating JPA entity classes.
   - Mapping entity classes to database tables.

3. Repository Interfaces
   - Using JpaRepository and custom repository interfaces.
   - Common repository methods (e.g., CRUD operations).

4. Queries with Query Methods
   - Writing queries using method naming conventions.
   - Using derived queries and parameter expressions.

5. JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language)
   - Writing JPQL queries to retrieve data.
   - Using JPQL functions and joins.

6. Pagination and Sorting
   - Implementing pagination and sorting in query results.

7. Auditing
   - Enabling entity auditing with @CreatedBy, @LastModifiedBy, and @CreatedDate annotations.
   - Customizing auditing fields and behavior.

8. Associations and Relationships
   - Mapping one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.
   - Fetch types and cascade types.

Advanced Spring Boot Data JPA Topics:
=====================================

9. Native SQL Queries
   - Executing native SQL queries with @Query annotation.
   - Mapping query results to custom DTOs.

10. Specification and Criteria API
    - Creating complex queries with the Criteria API.
    - Using Specifications for dynamic queries.

11. Caching in JPA

    - Integrating with NoSQL databases like MongoDB.
    - Mapping documents to JPA entities.

19. Testing and Test Data
    - Writing unit and integration tests for JPA repositories.
    - Creating test data and using test containers.

20. Best Practices and Real-world Use Cases
    - Applying best practices for using Spring Boot Data JPA in real-world applications.
    - Analyzing and implementing advanced use cases.
