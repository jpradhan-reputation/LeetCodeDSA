Fundamental REST Web Service Concepts:
======================================

1. Introduction to REST
   - What is REST (Representational State Transfer)?
   - Understanding the principles and constraints of REST.

2. HTTP Methods and Status Codes
   - Common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
   - HTTP status codes and their meanings.

3. Resource URIs
   - Designing resource URIs.
   - URL encoding and path parameters.

4. Request and Response
   - Handling HTTP requests and responses.
   - Content negotiation (XML, JSON, etc.).

5. HTTP Headers
   - Common HTTP headers (e.g., Content-Type, Accept).
   - Custom headers for authentication and metadata.

Advanced REST Web Service Topics:
=================================

6. HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)
   - Understanding HATEOAS and its role in REST.
   - Implementing hypermedia links in responses.

7. Request and Response Data
   - Request payload (JSON, XML) handling and validation.
   - Custom serialization and deserialization.

8. RESTful Authentication and Authorization
   - Authentication methods (e.g., Basic Auth, OAuth2).
   - Authorization mechanisms and role-based access control.

9. Versioning REST APIs
   - Different approaches to API versioning (e.g., URI versioning, custom headers).
   - Handling backward compatibility.

10. Exception Handling
    - Handling errors and exceptions gracefully.
    - Custom error responses and status codes.

11. RESTful Testing
    - Unit testing and integration testing of RESTful web services.
    - Testing tools and frameworks.

12. Caching in REST
    - Caching strategies and HTTP caching headers.
    - Handling cache invalidation.

13. REST Best Practices and Guidelines
    - Industry best practices for designing RESTful APIs.
    - Code structuring and organization.

14. Security in RESTful Web Services
    - Security threats and countermeasures.
    - Securing REST APIs with TLS, CSRF protection, and other security mechanisms.

15. Building Scalable REST Services
    - Load balancing, clustering, and horizontal scaling.
    - Using caching and CDNs for performance optimization.

16. Real-world Examples and Case Studies
    - Analyzing and implementing RESTful web services in real-world scenarios.
    - Best practices from case studies.

17. API Documentation
    - Creating interactive API documentation with tools like Swagger.
    - Documentation best practices.

18. API Governance
    - API lifecycle management, version control, and governance frameworks.

19. Microservices and REST
    - Building RESTful microservices.
    - Service discovery and communication between microservices.

20. Hypermedia
    - In-depth understanding of hypermedia in REST.
    - Practical use of hypermedia controls.
