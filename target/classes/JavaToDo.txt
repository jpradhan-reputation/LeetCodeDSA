Advanced Core Java Syllabus:
============================
1. Java Generics:
	-> Wildcards, bounded types, and type erasure.
	-> Generic methods and classes.
	-> Generic collections and their usage.
	-> Implementing your own generic classes.

2. Enumerations and Annotations:
	-> Enumerations and their advantages.
	-> Annotations and their uses (custom annotations, meta-annotations).
	-> Built-in Java annotations (e.g., @Override, @Deprecated, @FunctionalInterface).

3. Advanced Exception Handling:
	-> Custom exceptions and best practices.
	-> Using try-with-resources with AutoCloseable resources.
	-> Multi-catch and rethrowing exceptions.

4. Java I/O and NIO:
	-> Buffered I/O and character streams.
	-> Serialization and deserialization.
	-> NIO concepts (Buffers, Channels, Selectors).
	-> File I/O enhancements in Java NIO.2.

5. Java Concurrency:
	-> Advanced thread synchronization techniques.
	-> Concurrent collections (e.g., ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList).
	-> Atomic variables and classes.
	-> Executors framework and parallel programming.

6. Java Memory Management:
	-> JVM memory structure and garbage collection.
	-> Memory leaks and how to prevent them.
	-> JVM tuning and profiling tools.

7. Reflection and Java Reflection API:
	-> Class loading mechanisms.
	-> Introspection, getting class information at runtime.
	-> Dynamically invoking methods and working with fields.

8. Java Classloaders:
	-> The three-tier classloading architecture.
	-> Custom classloaders and their use cases.

9. Advanced Design Patterns:
	-> Creational, structural, and behavioral patterns.
	-> Applying patterns like Observer, Command, Strategy, etc., in real-world scenarios.

10. Functional Programming Concepts (Java 8+):
	-> Lambda expressions and method references.
	-> Functional interfaces and built-in functional interfaces (e.g., Predicate, Function, Consumer).
	-> Streams API for data processing.
	-> Optional class and its use in handling null values.

11. Java Modules (Java 9+):
	-> Introduction to Java modules (project Jigsaw).
	-> Creating and using modules.
	-> Module dependencies and module descriptors.

12. Java Security and Cryptography:
	-> Securing Java applications with access control.
	-> Using Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) for encryption and decryption.

13. Advanced Java Networking:
	-> Sockets, ServerSocket, and URL classes.
	-> Non-blocking I/O with Java NIO.

14. Java Reflection and Bytecode Manipulation:
	-> Reflection API for inspecting classes and objects.
	-> Bytecode manipulation libraries like ASM or ByteBuddy.

15. Java 8+ New Features and Updates:
	-> Default and static methods in interfaces.
	-> Method references, streams, and collectors.
	-> New date and time API (java.time package).
