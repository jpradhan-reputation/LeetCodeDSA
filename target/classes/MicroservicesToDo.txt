Fundamental Microservices Concepts:
===================================

1. Introduction to Microservices
   - Understanding the principles and benefits of microservices architecture.
   - Key characteristics, such as single-responsibility, small services, and decentralization.

2. Microservices vs. Monolithic Architecture
   - Comparing microservices with monolithic architecture.
   - When to choose microservices over monoliths.

3. Service Design and Decoupling
   - Designing microservices with clear boundaries.
   - Defining APIs and contracts.

4. Service Discovery and Registration
   - Implementing service discovery with tools like Eureka or Consul.
   - Dynamic service registration.

5. Load Balancing and API Gateways
   - Load balancing between microservices.
   - Implementing API gateways to manage API requests.

6. Distributed Data Management
   - Data consistency in microservices.
   - Strategies for data sharing and synchronization.

7. Logging and Monitoring
   - Implementing centralized logging with tools like ELK stack.
   - Monitoring and alerting with tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

Advanced Microservices Topics:
==============================

8. Containerization and Orchestration
   - Using Docker for containerization.
   - Orchestration with Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.

9. Security in Microservices
   - Implementing security measures, including authentication and authorization.
   - Using OAuth2, JWT, and API keys.

10. Circuit Breaker and Resilience Patterns
    - Implementing circuit breakers with tools like Hystrix.
    - Resilience patterns like retry and timeout.

11. Messaging and Event-Driven Architecture
    - Building asynchronous microservices with messaging systems (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).
    - Event-driven communication.

12. Microservices Testing
    - Strategies for testing microservices individually and as a system.
    - Using tools like Postman and REST-assured.

13. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)
    - Setting up CI/CD pipelines for microservices.
    - Strategies for blue-green deployments and canary releases.

14. Microservices Frameworks and Tools
    - Exploring microservices frameworks and platforms.
    - Spring Boot for Java-based microservices.

15. Performance Optimization
    - Performance tuning for microservices.
    - Load testing and profiling.

16. API Versioning and Evolution
    - Strategies for versioning microservices.
    - Handling backward compatibility.

17. Scalability and Elasticity
    - Auto-scaling microservices.
    - Handling increased load and traffic.

18. Serverless Microservices
    - Understanding serverless architecture and its role in microservices.
    - Using platforms like AWS Lambda or Azure Functions.

19. Real-world Use Cases and Case Studies
    - Analyzing and implementing microservices in real-world scenarios.
    - Best practices from case studies.

20. API Governance and Management
    - API lifecycle management, documentation, and analytics.
    - API gateways and management tools.
