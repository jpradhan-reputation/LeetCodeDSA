Fundamental SOAP Web Service Concepts:
======================================

1. Introduction to SOAP
   - What is SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)?
   - Understanding the principles and characteristics of SOAP.

2. SOAP Messages
   - Structure of SOAP messages (envelope, header, body).
   - SOAP message format (XML-based).

3. Web Service Description Language (WSDL)
   - Role and structure of WSDL documents.
   - Creating and understanding WSDL files.

4. SOAP Binding
   - SOAP over HTTP and other transport protocols.
   - Configuring SOAP bindings.

5. XML Schema (XSD)
   - Understanding XML schemas.
   - Defining data types and structures in XSD.

6. SOAP vs. REST Comparison
   - Comparing SOAP and RESTful web services.
   - When to choose SOAP over REST.
