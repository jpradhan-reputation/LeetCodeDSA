Creational Design Patterns:
===========================

1. Singleton Pattern
   - Implementing a class with a single instance.
   - Ensuring global access to that instance.

2. Factory Method Pattern
   - Defining an interface for creating objects.
   - Subclasses implement the factory method.

3. Abstract Factory Pattern
   - Creating families of related or dependent objects.
   - Ensuring that the created objects are compatible.

4. Builder Pattern
   - Separating the construction of complex objects.
   - Fluent interface for building objects.

5. Prototype Pattern
   - Cloning objects to create new instances.
   - Customizing the cloned object.

Structural Design Patterns:
===========================

6. Adapter Pattern
   - Making one interface compatible with another.
   - Wrapping an incompatible interface.

7. Decorator Pattern
   - Adding behavior to objects dynamically.
   - Composing objects with additional features.

8. Proxy Pattern
   - Controlling access to an object.
   - Providing a surrogate or placeholder for another object.

9. Composite Pattern
   - Composing objects into tree structures.
   - Treating both individual objects and compositions uniformly.

10. Bridge Pattern
    - Separating an object's abstraction from its implementation.
    - Allowing changes in one to not affect the other.

Behavioral Design Patterns:
===========================

11. Observer Pattern
    - Defining a one-to-many dependency between objects.
    - Notifying multiple objects about state changes.

12. Strategy Pattern
    - Defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one.
    - Making them interchangeable without altering the client code.

13. Command Pattern
    - Encapsulating a request as an object.
    - Allowing parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

14. Chain of Responsibility Pattern
    - Passing a request along a chain of handlers.
    - Letting each handler decide whether to process or pass the request.

15. State Pattern
    - Allowing an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
    - Encapsulating state-specific behavior.

Architectural Design Patterns:
==============================

16. MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern
    - Separating an application into three interconnected components.
    - Managing user interface, data, and control logic.

17. DAO (Data Access Object) Pattern
    - Separating the data access logic from the business logic.
    - Providing a clean interface for data manipulation.

18. Dependency Injection Pattern
    - Inversion of Control (IoC) container usage.
    - Injecting dependencies instead of creating them.

19. Service Locator Pattern
    - Centralized registry for services.
    - Reducing the coupling between clients and service providers.

20. Repository Pattern
    - Mediating between the domain model and data mapping.
    - Abstracting the data access layer.

Concurrency Design Patterns:
============================

21. Producer-Consumer Pattern
    - Coordinating the operation of producers and consumers.
    - Using a shared buffer for communication.

22. Mutex Pattern
    - Controlling access to a shared resource with a mutex.
    - Ensuring exclusive access in multithreaded environments.

23. Reader-Writer Pattern
    - Allowing multiple readers but only one writer to access shared data.
    - Managing concurrent access in a balanced way.

24. Thread Pool Pattern
    - Managing a pool of worker threads for parallel processing.
    - Reusing threads to avoid thread creation overhead.

25. Barrier Pattern
    - Synchronizing threads to wait at a barrier until all are ready.
    - Coordinating activities in a parallel process.
